ğŸ‘‹Hello! Welcome to my Github, this is the first game that I managed to create while I learned C++ at my school. It uses a ton of If-else statements, and gives the user a menu and two options to play either the game MADLIB or ADVENTURE.

ğŸ“–ğŸ˜„MADLID is where the user is able to put in a bunch of different verbs, adverbs, nouns, etc. to create a story of their own choice!ğŸ“–ğŸ˜„

ğŸ—½ADVENTURE is where the user is able to go out on, an adventure of course, and the setting is based in Staten Island, and you would use different types of Public Transportation to go to the cityğŸŒƒ or the other locations within Staten Island!ğŸ—½
